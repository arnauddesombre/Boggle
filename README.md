# Boggle Solver
Solver for Boggle.<br>
<i>boggle.py</i> finds all valid solutions of any Boggle board (classic 4x4, or any custom size).

Boggle is a game distributed by Hasbro (formerly Parker Brothers), see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle) for more information. The game involves a board made up of 16 cubic dice, where each die has a letter printed on each of its 6 sides. At the beginning of the game, the 16 dice are shaken and randomly distributed into a 4-by-4 tray, with only the top sides of the dice visible. The players compete to accumulate points by building valid words from the dice, according to the following rules:
- A valid word must be composed by following a sequence of adjacent diceâ€”two dice are adjacent if they are horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbors,
- A valid word can use each die at most once,
- A valid word must contain at least 3 letters,
- A valid word must be in the dictionary (which typically does not contain proper nouns). 

Parameters:<br>
A dictionary, as a text file containing the list of all valid words, one word per line.<br>
A Boggle board, as a text file with <i>number_of_rows</i> and <i>number_of_columns</i> on the first line (two numbers, separated by one or more spaces), followed by <i>number_of_rows</i> lines, each containing <i>number_of_columns</i> characters separated by one or more spaces. See an example of board below.

Output:<br>
The number of valid words found, the total score, and the list of longest words found.

Algorithm:<br>
The dictionary is stored as an R-way TRIE, which allows for extremely efficient search. It takes a couple of seconds to crete the TRIE, but the solving of any 4x4 Boggle boards is instantaneous.

Example of board:<br>
4 4<br>
G N E S<br>
S R I P<br>
E T A L<br>
T S E B<br>
(it contains 1351 words, including PLASTERINGS, SPLATTERING and TERNEPLATES, for a total score of 4540)

Note that letter Q as a special treatment in the English Boggle:<br>
In he English language, the letter Q is almost always followed by the letter U. Consequently, the side of one die is printed with the two-letter sequence Qu instead of Q (and this two-letter sequence must be used together when forming words). When scoring, Qu counts as two letters; for example, the word QuEUE scores as a 5-letter word even though it is formed by following a sequence of only 4 dice.<br>
Example of board with the letter Q (for which QuEUE is solution):<br>
2 2<br>
Qu E<br>
U  E<br>
